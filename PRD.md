# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview

**Product Name:** _(Working Title)_ FriendShaped Hybrid  
**Description:**  
FriendShaped Hybrid is a self-hosted communication platform combining the best features of Slack and Discord with a business-friendly user experience. It emphasizes robust enterprise integrations including OIDC/SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) and Authentik compatibility, while ensuring secure, S3-backed data storage for backups. The platform is designed to serve organizations that demand control over their data and infrastructure without unnecessary "bells and whistles" like inbuilt AI features.

**Target Audience:**  
- Mid-to-large enterprises  
- IT departments requiring self-hosted, secure communication tools  
- Organizations needing integration with Authentik for identity management  
- Businesses that require S3-compatible backup mechanisms  

---

## 2. Business Problem Statement

**Challenges Addressed:**  
- **Data Sovereignty & Security:** Many organizations are concerned with third-party cloud services for communication due to data governance and privacy issues.  
- **Enterprise Integration:** Existing consumer-focused communication tools (like Discord) or those with "overblown" features (like inbuilt AI) are not tailored for professional use or compliance with enterprise security standards.  
- **Self-Hosting Requirements:** Companies prefer solutions that can be deployed on their own infrastructure, ensuring complete control over data and configuration.  
- **Seamless SSO Integration:** Businesses require streamlined authentication workflows that integrate with existing identity management systems (e.g., Authentik) via standards like OIDC or SAML.  
- **Reliable Backup Solutions:** Dependable integration with S3 storage for backups is essential for disaster recovery and data retention policies.

---

## 3. Goals and Objectives

1. **Enterprise-Grade UX:**  
   - Deliver a user interface that is intuitive for business users, with a professional look and feel that minimizes distractions.

2. **Robust Messaging Features:**  
   - Provide a rich messaging experience combining channels, direct messaging, threads, and file sharing, similar to Slack and Discord.
  
3. **Secure and Compliant Authentication:**  
   - Integrate OIDC/SAML authentication mechanisms, with specific support for Authentik to ensure smooth SSO workflows.

4. **Self-Hosting Capability:**  
   - Offer complete self-hosting options allowing deployment on customer-controlled servers or private cloud environments.

5. **S3-Backed Data Storage:**  
   - Ensure that all backups can be stored in and restored from S3-compatible storage systems.

6. **Business-First Tooling:**  
   - Focus solely on features that enhance business communication and collaboration without extraneous consumer-grade gimmicks (e.g., inbuilt AI functionalities).

  - `/api/v1/messages/*` - Message operations
  - `/api/v1/users/*` - User management
  - `/api/v1/files/*` - File operations
  - `/api/v1/admin/*` - Administrative functions

- **WebSocket Events:**
  ```json
  {
    "type": "message.new",
    "payload": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "channel_id": "uuid",
      "content": "string",
      "user": {}
    }
  }
  ```

## 8. Assumptions & Dependencies

- **Assumptions:**  
  - Target organizations have the technical expertise to manage self-hosted solutions.  
  - Authentik is the chosen identity management system; support for alternative providers may be considered as an extension.

- **Dependencies:**  
  - Reliance on third-party libraries for OIDC/SAML protocols.  
  - Dependency on AWS S3 or S3-compatible services for backup functionality.

---

## 9. Future Considerations

- **Integration Plugins:**  
  - Potential for additional enterprise integrations (e.g., project management tools, ticketing systems) if requested by customers.
  
- **Mobile Applications:**  
  - Native mobile apps (iOS/Android) might be developed in future phases for on-the-go access.

- **Analytics and Reporting:**  
  - Advanced reporting features to analyze communication patterns and system usage for enterprises.

---

## 10. Out-of-Scope

- **Inbuilt AI Features:**  
  - The platform will deliberately exclude features such as inbuilt AI to ensure focus on business tooling.
  
- **Consumer-Focused Features:**  
  - Features primarily targeting casual communication or entertainment (e.g., custom emojis beyond business needs, non-professional gamification) are not part of the core offering.

---

## 11. Approval and Next Steps

- **Review and Feedback:**  
  - Circulate this document among key stakeholders (IT, Security, and Business Leaders) for feedback.
  
- **Finalization:**  
  - Update PRD based on stakeholder input and finalize the product roadmap.

- **Kick-Off:**  
  - Initiate project planning and assign roles for the development phases.

---

This PRD lays the foundation for a robust, secure, and enterprise-ready communication tool that meets the specific needs of organizations requiring self-hosted solutions, Authentik integration, and S3-backed backups, without superfluous features.
